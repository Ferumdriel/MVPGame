# MVPGame
Minimum Viable Product Game. I put focus on making it playable with the least needed features and after that I'll keep upgrading it.
VMP v0.1
- Added automatic fights
- Player is able to save and load his progress
- Player gains experience by killing monsters
- Experience yields to level gains which increase health
- Player can choose 1 out of 4 actions: Heal, Fight, Save, Exit



First goal:
- Let player fight and save his progress - DONE

Next goal:
- Set player in different places so he can fight different creatures - TODO
